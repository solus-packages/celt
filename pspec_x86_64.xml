        <Summary xml:lang="en">CELT is a very low delay audio codec designed for high-quality communications.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Traditional full-bandwidth  codecs such as Vorbis and AAC can offer high
quality but they require codec delays of hundreds of milliseconds, which
makes them unsuitable  for real-time interactive applications like tele-
conferencing. Speech targeted codecs, such as Speex or G.722, have lower
20-40ms delays but their speech focus and limited sampling rates 
restricts their quality, especially for music.
